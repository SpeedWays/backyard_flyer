## Overview
Udacity Flying Car Nanodegree - Term 1 - Project 2 - 3D Motion Planning

This is the second project on Udacity's Flying Car Nanodegree. This poject demostrate how the drone fly from the start to goal through the 2.5D map. Discretize the enviroment into a grid & graph representation. A* search algorithm is used to find the shortest path. 

### Setup
* Download the [simulator](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Simulator-Releases/releases).
* Setup [Python environment](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Term1-Starter-Kit)
* Execute the fly by `python motion_planning.py`
* Refer to the [UdaciDrone API](https://udacity.github.io/udacidrone/) if needed
* More detail information about simulator and python environment setup can be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Motion-Planning/blob/master/README.md).



### Starter Code

I started with following files:

* `backyard_flyer_solution.py`
* `motion_planning_search_grid.py`
* `motion_planning_search_graph.py`

`motion_planning_search_grid.py` is a modified version of `backyard_flyer_solution.py` that leverages some extra functions in `planning_utils_search_grid.py`. The scripts contain a planning implementation by using 'create_grid()'.

A grid for a particular altitude and safety margin around obstacles is also be build. To create the grid using ```create_grid()``` in ```planning_utils_search_grid.py```
the planner performs path planning in the method `plan_path()` with following steps: 

1. Reads in the file `colliders.csv` containing obstacle data
2. Extracts a grid representation of a 2D configuration space with the method `create_grid()` in `planning_utils_search_grid.py`
3. Defines the start and goal points
4. Performs A* search to find a path from start to goal with the method `a_star()` in `planning_utils_search_grid.py`
5. Converts the planned path into waypoints, and send the waypoints to simulator

Here's the grid configuration space created from `colliders.csv`, green color areas are the safety distance from the actual obstacles:

```
 # read lat0, lon0 from colliders into floating point values
 header = open(map_file_name).readline()
 s = re.findall(r"[-+]?\d*\.\d+|\d+", header)
 self.lat_0 = float(s[1]) #global hoome position of drone
 self.lon_0 = float(s[3])

 # Read in obstacle map
 data = np.loadtxt(map_file_name, delimiter=',', dtype='Float64', skiprows=2)
        
 # Define a grid for a particular altitude and safety margin around obstacles
 self.grid, self.north_offset, self.east_offset = create_grid(data, self.TARGET_ALTITUDE, self.SAFETY_DISTANCE)
```

The home position will be set while the drone arming.
To set the global home position using ```self.set_home_position().```

```
   def arming_transition(self):
        self.flight_state = States.ARMING
        print("<arming transition>")
        self.arm()
        self.take_control()
        self.set_home_position(self.lon_0, self.lat_0, 0)
        print(f'Home lat : {self.lat_0}, lon : {self.lon_0}')
```

## Path Planning
### Grid Based Implementation
In ```motion_planning_grid_map.py``` , you can choose the start and goal location. But the start location should be close to the home loaction of drone. So the drone will fly though the path.

### A* search with diagonal motion
In ```planning_utils_search_grid.py``` , the ```a_stat()``` calculate the shortest path and check if the note is valid or not by using  ```valid_actions(grid, current_node)```. The ```action()``` enum class define the actions. So the following code were added for diagonal motion accordingly.

```
    if x + 1 > n or y + 1 > m or grid[x + 1, y + 1] == 1:
        valid_actions.remove(Action.SOUTH_EAST)
    if x - 1 < 0 or y + 1 > m or grid[x - 1, y + 1] == 1:
        valid_actions.remove(Action.NORTH_EAST)
    if x + 1 > n or y - 1 < 0 or grid[x + 1, y - 1] == 1:
        valid_actions.remove(Action.SOUTH_WEST)
    if x - 1 < 0 or y - 1 < 0 or grid[x - 1, y - 1] == 1:
        valid_actions.remove(Action.NORTH_WEST)
```

The cost of diagonal motions is sqrt(2)
```
    SOUTH_EAST = (1, 1, np.sqrt(2))
    NORTH_EAST = (-1, 1, np.sqrt(2))
    SOUTH_WEST = (1, -1, np.sqrt(2))
    NORTH_WEST = (-1, -1, np.sqrt(2))
```

## Remove unnecessary waypoints
After path planing, run collinearity test to remove unnecessary waypoints by calling ```prune_path()```.

```
def prune_path(path, epsilon=1e-5):
    """
    Returns prune path.
    """
    def point(p):
        return np.array([p[0], p[1], 1.]).reshape(1, -1)

    def collinearity_check(p1, p2, p3):   
        m = np.concatenate((p1, p2, p3), 0)
        det = np.linalg.det(m)
        return abs(det) < epsilon

    pruned_path = [p for p in path]
    i = 0
    while i < len(pruned_path) - 2:
        p1 = point(pruned_path[i])
        p2 = point(pruned_path[i+1])
        p3 = point(pruned_path[i+2])

        if collinearity_check(p1, p2, p3):
            pruned_path.remove(pruned_path[i+1])
        else:
            i += 1
    return pruned_path
```


### Graph Based Implementation
In ```motion_planning_search_map.py``` , you choose the start and goal location. A graph with edges is created by using ```create_graph_and_edges()``` in ```planning_utils_search_gaph.py```. The closet notes will be found according to the locations, then use the ```a_star()``` to calculate shortest path according to the graph.
